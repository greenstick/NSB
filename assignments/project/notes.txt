microRNA from virus
Host protein
motif detection using existing algorithms 
Are microRNAs from virus interacting with human proteins

find human virus and look for specific microRNA that can interact with human proteins

Can make strict microRNA to protein directed

Influenza h1n1

protein to protein interaction network
overlay microRNA targets 
starting from microRNA root node, navigate from through protein protein interaction network
How does microRNA modify expression
Will not produce new transcripts
Will bind to micro RNA proteins and modify expression
