** Assignment 4

Download Reactome interaction files in PSI-MITAB format from 
http://www.reactome.org/download with the link: Human protein-protein
interaction pairs in PSI-MITAB format. 

Extract interactions into pair-wise gene symbols: one interaction per
line (e.g. NFS1\tITGA7). 

Map the TCGA PanCancer genes, which were provided in Week 2, to create a sub-network. Calculate four 
centralities defined as in Table 7.1 in the Newman book for each gene 
in the sub-network.

Please program in your preferred language, and use any third-party 
packages (e.g. matrix and/or network packages) you think are 
necessary.

Notes: This Reactome interaction network is different from the 
Reactome FI network. You should find gene symbols in the file. 
The calculation of centralities should be applied to the sub-network.

Please submit your code, sub-network for 127 genes, and calculated 
centralities.
