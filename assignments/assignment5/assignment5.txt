** Assignment 5

Implement breadth first search (BFS) algorithm and apply it to the 
sub-network for 127 cancer genes you have generated last week: 

1). Find how many components; 
2). Calculate pair-wise distances (should be one large matrix, likely of largest component) 
3). Calculate average shortest path of the component and the diameter of the sub-network (largest existing path.)

Submit your code and the running results.

This assignment will be submitted in two weeks so you have time working 
on your project proposal.
